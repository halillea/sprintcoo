7. File Storage
Where do generated/processed files go? 
Google Drive 
using state of the art naming for folders and files

8. Email Service for Notifications
Do you have a preferred email service? (SendGrid, Resend, or should I suggest one?)
suggest the best free and paid options

9. Google Sheets Integration
For progress tracking, 
Google Sheets integration is required for MVP
this is one of the time saver, the user/ceo has google drive connected and synchronized to his laptop
he will see anything that was added to his folder

10. Agent Definition
When the Digital COO "creates an agent" - what does that look like technically? Is it:
this depend on the task difficulty
if the 'digital coo' can create automated agent, he will generate it, and store it inside the app and also store a copy in the google drive folder
if it is a prompt that need to be executed, and need some back and forth beofre geting the results. A prompt will be added to the folder. How to use the prompt will appear on the dashboard of the user/ceo
if the tasks need a script or code automation to be executed by a human, then the code/script is provided inside the google drive

11. The Example Projects
Are saasbizz.com, saasitron.com, hostipedia.com are real projects that will go live within the next weeks
There is already some draft content posted on each one.

12. Web Scraping
For tasks like "scrape startup descriptions" - should the Digital COO actually perform web scraping, or generate instructions/scripts for it?
this is a task that the 'digital coo' can handle, but it can trigger some errors, as scraping can be difficult with some websites.
If the 'digital coo' fail to fetch the content. he will just alert the user/ceo
there are some api/services that we may integrate to make it seamless. we just dont do that with the MVP

Before generating any code, ask me all the questions needed to be sure at 100% of what is the exact scope of what we are building.
Only generate code after validation.
